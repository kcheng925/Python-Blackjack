# Python Blackjack project

Taking my time during quartine to learn python on sololearn and then applying some of that info to create a simple Blackjack project.

First will be implementing rules of the game and then will look into how to implement a GUI.

## Completed so far:
- Hit function
- Initial cards dealt
- Dealer hits on hard/soft 16 and below
- Player is dealt 2 cards
- Given options to hit, split, stand, double down
- Player can hit

## Todo
- Double down class
- Player bust rule
